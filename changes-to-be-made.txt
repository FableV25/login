list of things that needs to me corrected or made or whatever:
backend:
    -> api      ->  models.py       =>  making the title and content of the note a rquired field ✓
                    tests.py        =>  Add testing on note methods ✓
                    views.py        =>  the code    "# if error response to react client (on every method that response to client)
                                                    # return Response({
                                                    #     'status': 'error', 
                                                    #     'message': str(e)
                                                    # }, status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)"
                                        at line 38, also at line 67 there was a standar suggested                    
                                                    "# If error
                                                    # return Response({
                                                    #     'status': 'error', 
                                                    #     'message': str(e)
                                                    # }, status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                                                    # If success
                                                    # return Response({
                                                    #     'status': 'Success',
                                                    #     'message': 'Sources retrieved by level.',                                                        
						    #     'data': serializer.data
                                                    # }, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)"
                                        also showing the note before deleting ✓ (kind of)                
    -> backend  -> settings.py      => Add a visual interface, like pgadmin line 106 ✓ (think so)
                   urls.py          => asking for user views, comment related to anthoer coment on the views.py at backend/api in line 103 (didnt get it)

Frontend
    -> forntend ->  constants.js                =>  rename the refresh token and normal token ✓
                    api.js                      =>  "Try with utils folder | src/utils/api.js" migth put it in that directory? ✓
                    app.jsx                     =>  Line 15, create a Logout component instead of the existing one ✓
                ->  pages   ->  home.jsx        =>  line 93, put some style on that one ✓
                                login.jsx       =>  ture 
                                notFound.jsx    =>  style ✓
                    components  ->  Note.jsx    =>  line 5, do it in its own component ✓ 
                                ->  form.jsx    =>  hope for the framework to not get bitchy abut the names 
                                                    try using the muilab thing  (tommorow)
                                                    and change the token names as in the "constants.js" file ✓
