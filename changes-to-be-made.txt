list of things that needs to me corrected or made or whatever:
backend:
    -> api      ->  models.py       =>  making the title and content of the note a rquired field ✓
                    tests.py        =>  Add testing on note methods ✓
                    views.py        =>  the code    "# if error response to react client (on every method that response to client)
                                                    # return Response({
                                                    #     'status': 'error', 
                                                    #     'message': str(e)
                                                    # }, status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)"
                                        at line 38, also at line 67 there was a standar suggested                    
                                                    "# If error
                                                    # return Response({
                                                    #     'status': 'error', 
                                                    #     'message': str(e)
                                                    # }, status=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
                                                    # If success
                                                    # return Response({
                                                    #     'status': 'Success',
                                                    #     'message': 'Sources retrieved by level.',                                                        #     'data': serializer.data

                                        also showing the note before deleting ✓ (kind of)                
    -> backend  -> settings.py      => Add a visual interface, like pgadmin line 106
